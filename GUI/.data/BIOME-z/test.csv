"1","The Gut Microbiome as a Target for IBD Treatment: Are We There Yet?","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review aims to highlight recent research on the gut microbiome in IBD and the application of microbiome-modulating therapies for the treatment of IBD including the use of the microbiome as an indicator for disease severity and treatment response. \ RECENT FINDINGS: Despite the high number of gut microbiome studies and emerging evidence supporting the gut microbiome's involvement in disease pathogenesis, no single microorganism has been identified as a pathogenic agent in IBD. Retrospective studies and meta-analyses on antibiotic use in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and long-term outcomes are conflicting. Similarly, the use of probiotics for the treatment of IBD remains inconclusive; however, some encouraging results are emerging as microbial concoctions are optimized to include beneficial bacterial strains. Fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) is currently emerging as one of the more promising microbiome-modulating IBD therapies. FMT studies in ulcerative colitis have shown improved remission rates compared to placebo; however, relatively small study sample sizes and varied treatment methods, limit definitive conclusions. With clear evidence of an IBD gut dysbiosis, novel therapies to treat and prevent disease relapse will undoubtedly require a microbiome-modulating approach. The complexity and variability of IBD disease pathogenesis (disease phenotype, gut microbiome, host genetic susceptibility, and environmental factors) will likely require a personalized and multidimensional treatment approach where microbiome-modulating therapy is coupled with other therapies to target other IBD disease components."
"1","Comparison of the oral microbiome of patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis and periodontitis-free subjects","Objective \ The primary objectives of the study were to assess differences in complex subgingival bacterial composition between periodontitis-free persons and patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis (gAgP). \ Background \ The composition of the oral microbiota plays an important role for both oral and systemic diseases. However, the complex nature of the oral microbiome and its homeostasis is still poorly understood. \ Material and methods \ We compared the microbiome of 13 periodontitis-free persons to 13 patients with gAgP. The 16S rRNA genes were amplified, targeting the V3/V4 region using the MiSeq platform. \ Results \ In total, 1713 different bacterial species were mapped according to the Greengenes database. Using the Shannon index, no significant differences in alpha diversity were found between the two study groups. In principal component and linear discriminant analyses, disease-specific differences in beta diversity of the microbiome composition were evaluated. Bacteroidetes, Spirochaetes, and Synergistetes were more abundant in gAgP whereas Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria were associated with a healthy periodontium. At the bacterial species level, we showed that Porphyromonas gingivalis is the strongest indicator of gAgP. Treponema denticola and Tanerella forsythia of the “red complex” as well as Filifactor alocis were among the ten best biomarkers for gAgP. \ Conclusions \ These results broaden our knowledge of disease-specific differences in the microbial community associated with generalized AgP. A more complex view of the composition of the oral microbiome describes the etiology of generalized AgP in more detail. These results could help to individually adapt periodontal therapy in these patients."
"2","Stress and the microbiota–gut–brain axis in visceral pain: Relevance to irritable bowel syndrome","Visceral pain is a global term used to describe pain originating from the internal organs of the body, which affects a significant proportion of the population and is a common feature of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). While IBS is multifactorial, with no single etiology to completely explain the disorder, many patients also experience comorbid behavioral disorders, such as anxiety or depression; thus, IBS is described as a disorder of the gut–brain axis. Stress is implicated in the development and exacerbation of visceral pain disorders. Chronic stress can modify central pain circuitry, as well as change motility and permeability throughout the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. More recently, the role of the gut microbiota in the bidirectional communication along the gut–brain axis, and subsequent changes in behavior, has emerged. Thus, stress and the gut microbiota can interact through complementary or opposing factors to influence visceral nociceptive behaviors. This review will highlight the evidence by which stress and the gut microbiota interact in the regulation of visceral nociception. We will focus on the influence of stress on the microbiota and the mechanisms by which microbiota can affect the stress response and behavioral outcomes with an emphasis on visceral pain.

"1","Altered Microbiome in Patients With Cirrhosis and Complications","<p>In patients with cirrhosis, the gut microbiome are affected by multiple gut and systemic alterations. These changes lead to dysbiosis in the microbiota of different parts of the body, resulting in inflammation. The constant immune stimulation resulting in part from dysbiosis is associated with morbidity in patients with cirrhosis. Dysbiosis as a dynamic event worsens with decompensation such as with hepatic encephalopathy, infections or acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). These microbial patterns could be applied as diagnostic and prognostic measures in cirrhosis in the outpatient and inpatient setting. Current therapies for cirrhosis have differing impacts on gut microbial composition and functionality. Dietary modifications and the oral cavity have emerged as newer targetable factors to modulate the microbiome, which could affect inflammation and, potentially improve outcomes. Additionally, fecal microbial transplant is being increasingly studied to provide compositional and functional modulation of the microbiome. Ultimately, a combination of targeted therapies may be needed to provide an optimal gut milieu to improve outcomes in cirrhosis.</p>"
"1","A Comparison of Homogenization vs. Enzymatic Lysis for Microbiome Profiling in Clinical Endoscopic Biopsy Tissue Samples","Identification of the human microbiome has proven to be of utmost importance with the emerging role of bacteria in various physiological and pathological processes. High throughput sequencing strategies have evolved to assess the composition of the microbiome. To identify possible bias that may exist in the processing of tissue for whole genome sequencing (WGS), it is important to evaluate the extraction method on the overall microbial content and composition. Here we compare two different methods of extraction, homogenization versus enzymatic lysis, on gastric, esophageal and colorectal biopsies and survey the microbial content and composition using WGS and quantitative PCR (qPCR). We examined total bacterial content using universal 16S rDNA qPCR as well as the abundance of three phyla (Actinobacter, Firmicutes, Bacteriodetes) and one genus (Fusobacterium). We found minimal differences between the two extraction methods in the overall community structure or in the abundance of specific clade. Furthermore, based on our qPCR analysis, neither method demonstrated preferential extraction of any particular clade of bacteria, nor significantly altered the detection of gram-positive or gram-negative organisms. However, although the overall microbial composition remained the same and the most prevalent bacteria could be detected effectively using either method, we demonstrate that the homogenization extraction method provides higher microbial DNA content and higher read counts from human tissue biopsy samples of the gastrointestinal tract."
"1","Exact variance component tests for longitudinal microbiome studies","In metagenomic studies, testing the association between microbiome composition and clinical outcomes translates to testing the nullity of variance components. Motivated by a lung human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) microbiome project, we study longitudinal microbiome data by using variance component models with more than two variance components. Current testing strategies only apply to models with exactly two variance components and when sample sizes are large. Therefore, they are not applicable to longitudinal microbiome studies. In this paper, we propose exact tests (score test, likelihood ratio test, and restricted likelihood ratio test) to (a) test the association of the overall microbiome composition in a longitudinal design and (b) detect the association of one specific microbiome cluster while adjusting for the effects from related clusters. Our approach combines the exact tests for null hypothesis with a single variance component with a strategy of reducing multiple variance components to a single one. Simulation studies demonstrate that our method has a correct type I error rate and superior power compared to existing methods at small sample sizes and weak signals. Finally, we apply our method to a longitudinal pulmonary microbiome study of HIV-infected patients and reveal two interesting genera Prevotella and Veillonella associated with forced vital capacity. Our findings shed light on the impact of the lung microbiome on HIV complexities. The method is implemented in the open-source, high-performance computing language Julia and is freely available at https://github.com/JingZhai63/VCmicrobiome."
"2","Gut microbiome and brain functional connectivity in infants-a preliminary study focusing on the amygdala","Recently, there has been a surge of interest in the possibility that microbial communities inhabiting the human gut could affect cognitive development and increase risk for mental illness via the 'microbiome-gut-brain axis.' Infancy likely represents a critical period for the establishment of these relationships, as it is the most dynamic stage of postnatal brain development and a key period in the maturation of the microbiome. Indeed, recent reports indicate that characteristics of the infant gut microbiome are associated with both temperament and cognitive performance. The neural circuits underlying these relationships have not yet been delineated. To address this gap, resting-state fMRI scans were acquired from 39 1-year-old human infants who had provided fecal samples for identification and relative quantification of bacterial taxa. Measures of alpha diversity were generated and tested for associations with measures of functional connectivity. Primary analyses focused on the amygdala as manipulation of the gut microbiota in animal models alters the structure and neurochemistry of this brain region. Secondary analyses explored functional connectivity of nine canonical resting-state functional networks. Alpha diversity was significantly associated with functional connectivity between the amygdala and thalamus and between the anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula. These regions play an important role in processing/responding to threat. Alpha diversity was also associated with functional connectivity between the supplementary motor area (SMA, representing the sensorimotor network) and the inferior parietal lobule (IPL). Importantly, SMA-IPL connectivity also related to cognitive outcomes at 2 years of age, suggesting a potential pathway linking gut microbiome diversity and cognitive outcomes during infancy. These results provide exciting new insights into the gut-brain axis during early human development and should stimulate further studies into whether microbiome-associated changes in brain circuitry influence later risk for psychopathology."
"1","A unified conceptual framework for prediction and control of microbiomes","Microbiomes impact nearly all systems on Earth, and despite vast differences among systems, we contend that it is possible and highly beneficial to develop a unified conceptual framework for understanding microbiome dynamics that is applicable across systems. The ability to robustly predict and control environmental and human microbiomes would provide impactful opportunities to sustain and improve the health of ecosystems and humans alike. Doing so requires understanding the processes governing microbiome temporal dynamics, which currently presents an enormous challenge. We contend, however, that new opportunities can emerge by placing studies of both environmental and human microbiome temporal dynamics in the context of a unified conceptual framework. Our conceptual framework poses that factors influencing the temporal dynamics of microbiomes can be grouped into three broad categories: biotic and abiotic history, internal dynamics, and external forcing factors. Both environmental and human microbiome science study these factors, but not in a coordinated or consistent way. Here we discuss opportunities for greater crosstalk across these domains, such as leveraging specific ecological concepts from environmental microbiome science to guide optimization of strategies to manipulate human microbiomes towards improved health. To achieve unified understanding, it is necessary to have a common body of theory developed from explicit iteration between models and molecular-based characterization of microbiome dynamics across systems. Only through such model-experiment iteration will we eventually achieve prediction and control across microbiomes that impact ecosystem sustainability and human health."
"1","Insights into microbiome research 4: The computational analysis","The computational analysis of microbiome samples is a highly specialized task, requiring powerful hardware and deep know-how not only in informatics and statistics but also in ecology and taxonomy. Different approaches must be followed based on the sequencing method (16S or shotgun) and while these can provide partially overlapping information, they are conceptually distinct. Understanding their differences and similarities can be useful in the interpretation of the results of microbiome studies."
"1","Whole grain-rich diet reduces body weight and systemic low-grade inflammation without inducing major changes of the gut microbiome: a randomised cross-over trial","Objective To investigate whether a whole grain diet alters the gut microbiome and insulin sensitivity, as well as biomarkers of metabolic health and gut functionality. \ Design 60 Danish adults at risk of developing metabolic syndrome were included in a randomised cross-over trial with two 8-week dietary intervention periods comprising whole grain diet and refined grain diet, separated by a washout period of ≥6 weeks. The response to the interventions on the gut microbiome composition and insulin sensitivity as well on measures of glucose and lipid metabolism, gut functionality, inflammatory markers, anthropometry and urine metabolomics were assessed. \ Results 50 participants completed both periods with a whole grain intake of 179±50 g/day and 13±10 g/day in the whole grain and refined grain period, respectively. Compliance was confirmed by a difference in plasma alkylresorcinols (p<0.0001). Compared with refined grain, whole grain did not significantly alter glucose homeostasis and did not induce major changes in the faecal microbiome. Also, breath hydrogen levels, plasma short-chain fatty acids, intestinal integrity and intestinal transit time were not affected. The whole grain diet did, however, compared with the refined grain diet, decrease body weight (p<0.0001), serum inflammatory markers, interleukin (IL)-6 (p=0.009) and C-reactive protein (p=0.003). The reduction in body weight was consistent with a reduction in energy intake, and IL-6 reduction was associated with the amount of whole grain consumed, in particular with intake of rye. \ Conclusion Compared with refined grain diet, whole grain diet did not alter insulin sensitivity and gut microbiome but reduced body weight and systemic low-grade inflammation. \ Trial registration number NCT01731366; Results."
"1","The vermiform appendix: an immunological organ sustaining a microbiome inoculum","The hominoid vermiform appendix has been characterized as a diverticulum of the caecum and describes an entity at the juxtaposition of the colon in the confluence of tanias. The independent development of the lymphoid follicle centres of the appendix is progressed at birth in the presence of the intestinal commensal microbiome, an obligatory prompt for the diversification of intestinal and extra-intestinal mucosal immunological tissue. In the vermiform appendix, this activity is centred on further developing the inventory of primary antibodies and the maturation of T- and B-lymphocyte cells in the follicles within the lymphoid tissue. Furthermore, the columnar epithelia, enterocytes and goblet cells comprise the complement of cells that occupy the lamina propria and muscularis mucosae of the vermiform appendix’s mucosa, while macrophages and an abundance of immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin G generating plasma cells seed the lamina propria. Intraepithelial immune cells consisting predominantly of specific CD8+ T regulatory lymphocytes occupy sites in the appendix analogous to those present in the intestinal epithelia of the caecal colon. The complement of bacterial genera concealed in the vermiform appendix is posited extant as a biofilm inoculum of the intestinal commensal microbiome. This facilitates re-inoculation of the proximal colon and to a lesser degree the terminal ilium post an intestinal perturbation such as occurs with daily lifestyle stressors, dietary choices and the short-term administration of antibiotics rather than an infectious fulminant colitis. A plausible appreciation results of the importance of multiple immunological aspects of a healthy vermiform appendix and the provision of a commensal biofilm to the gut that repairs a dysbiotic microbiome contributing to balancing intestinal pro- and anti-inflammatory activity for maintaining homeostasis in the gut. Since the composition of the gut microbiome can vary over the short-term and long-term, it is plausible that the appendix inoculum may be instrumental in maintaining the intestinal microbiome."
"2","Making Sense of … the Microbiome in Psychiatry","Microorganisms can be found almost anywhere, including in and on the human body. The collection of microorganisms associated with a certain location is called a microbiota, with its collective genetic material referred to as the microbiome. The largest population of microorganisms on the human body resides in the gastrointestinal tract; thus, it is not surprising that the most investigated human microbiome is the human gut microbiome. On average, the gut hosts microbes from more than 60 genera and contains more cells than the human body. The human gut microbiome has been shown to influence many aspects of host health, including more recently the brain., Several modes of interaction between the gut and the brain have been discovered, including via the synthesis of metabolites and neurotransmitters, activation of the vagus nerve, and activation of the immune system. A growing body of work is implicating the microbiome in a variety of psychological processes and neuropsychiatric disorders. These include mood and anxiety disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, and even neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Moreover, it is probable that most psychotropic medications have an impact on the microbiome., Here, an overview will be provided for the bidirectional role of the microbiome in brain health, age-associated cognitive decline, and neurological and psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, a primer on the common microbiological and bioinformatics techniques used to interrogate the microbiome will be provided. This review is meant to equip the reader with a primer to this exciting research area that is permeating all areas of biological psychiatry research."
"1","Partial restoration of the microbiota of cesarean-born infants via vaginal microbial transfer","Exposure of newborns to the maternal vaginal microbiotais interrupted with cesarean birthing. Babies delivered by cesarean section (C-section) acquire a microbiota that differs from that of vaginally delivered infants, and C-section delivery has been associated with increased risk for immune and metabolic disorders. Here we conducted a pilot study in which infants delivered by C-section were exposed to maternal vaginal fluids at birth. Similarly to vaginally delivered babies, the gut, oral and skin bacterial communities of these newborns during the first 30 d of life was enriched in vaginal bacteriawhich were underrepresented in unexposed C-sectiondelivered infantsand the microbiome similarity to those of vaginally delivered infants was greater in oral and skin samples than in anal samples. Although the long-term health consequences of restoring the microbiota of C-sectiondelivered infants remain unclear, our results demonstrate that vaginal microbes can be partially restored at birth in C-sectiondelivered babies."
"1","Re-examining causes of surgical site infections following elective surgery in the era of asepsis","<h2>Summary</h2><p>The currently accepted assumption that most surgical site infections (SSIs) occurring after elective surgery under standard methods of antisepsis are due to an intraoperative contamination event, remains unproven. We examined the available evidence in which microbial cultures of surgical wounds were taken at the conclusion of an operation and determined that such studies provide more evidence to refute that an SSI is due to intraoperative contamination than support it. We propose that alternative mechanisms of SSI development should be considered, such as when a sterile postoperative wound becomes infected by a pathogen originating from a site remote from the operative wound—eg, from the gums or intestinal tract (ie, the Trojan Horse mechanism). We offer a path forward to reduce SSI rates after elective surgery that includes undertaking genomic-based microbial tracking from the built environment (ie, the operating room and hospital bed), to the patient's own microbiome, and then to the surgical site. Finally, we posit that only by generating this dynamic microbial map can the true pathogenesis of SSIs be understood enough to inform novel preventive strategies against infection following elective surgery in the current era of asepsis.</p>"
